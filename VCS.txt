A Version Control System (VCS) is a program that tracks and records all the changes made in a coding project, a popular VSC program is Git. These types of programs are particularly helpful for large projects where more than one programmer is involved. Each contributor for the project has a specific ID, so everyone knows who, and when a change was made. Each contributor gets a unified view of the project. When a contributor is ready to “push” the changes made in the code it can write in the console git push/ or git pull, to pull the changes made by other contributors.
